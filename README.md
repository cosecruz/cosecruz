## 👋 About Me

I’m a backend-leaning software engineer who enjoys designing systems that are clean, dependable, and easy to operate.  
My strengths sit at the intersection of **backend engineering, cloud automation, DevOps, and developer experience**, where I build tools and services that scale without becoming painful to maintain.

I enjoy working with **Rust, TypeScript, Go, and Ruby**, with a growing focus on high-performance Rust systems, background task orchestration, distributed workloads, and automation pipelines.  
I prioritize **clean architecture, reproducible environments, strong testing discipline, observability, and secure-by-default workflows**.

I care about building things that last—and making the entire development-to-deployment lifecycle smoother for teams.

## 🚀 What I Do

- **Backend Engineering** – APIs, distributed workers, clean domain architectures.
- **Cloud & DevOps** – Docker, Kubernetes, IaC, CI/CD, GitHub Actions, deployment pipelines.
- **System Design** – scalability, reliability, observability, background jobs, queues.
- **Developer Tooling** – CLIs, workflow automation, project scaffolding, codegen.
- **AI-Augmented Engineering** – automated pipelines, smart defaults, model-assisted dev flows.

## 🧵 Projects

### 🔸 **SCARF — Developer Workflow & Deployment Orchestrator**
A minimal, modern tool that “wraps” a software project from first commit to production.  
SCARF provides an opinionated workflow for teams that want reliability without the overhead of maintaining a massive DevOps stack.

**Highlights**
- Automatic project scaffolding (Rust, TS, Go, etc.)
- Zero-guess CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions powered)
- Secure deploy flows with secrets, linting, tests, and quality gates
- Infrastructure bootstrap (Docker, IaC, configs)
- Local-to-production parity environments
- AI-powered code generation and workflow insights  
- Built for readability, reproducibility, and developer happiness

This project represents my passion for seamless engineering experiences and automated delivery pipelines.

### 🔸 **IJe — Unified Logistics & Transport Platform**
A smart logistics platform designed to handle delivery, freight, and courier operations in one cohesive system.

**Engineering Focus**
- Cleanly structured backend services
- Event-driven workflows (orders, dispatching, routing)
- Geo-services integration and optimized route logic
- Modular architecture for different transport verticals
- Automated CI/CD deployments and scalable cloud setup

IJe shows my ability to design real-world systems with reliability, automation, and domain clarity.

### 🔸 **Other Work**
I also build smaller tools and experiments that improve everyday engineering:

- **A Rust-powered job runner** for reliable background tasks  
- **A CLI toolkit** for scaffolding infra, configs, and deployments  
- **Monitoring/telemetry snippets** for quickly instrumenting apps  
- **API-first microservices** using Rust, Go, or Ruby  
- **Developer experience utilities** that reduce boilerplate and enforce best practices
